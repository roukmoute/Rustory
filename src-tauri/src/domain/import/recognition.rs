//! Local-artifact import recognition (domain layer).
//!
//! Pure, framework-free classification of an analyzed local artifact into
//! a typed recognition verdict — the import counterpart of `preflight.rs`.
//! A "partially usable" or "functionally blocked" artifact is a RESULT
//! STATE here, never an `AppError`: only transport failures (unreadable
//! file, failed DB write) are errors, surfaced by the application layer.
//!
//! Two flows share this taxonomy, each with its OWN aspect set and state
//! derivation (each contract is documented separately in the support
//! profile): the `.rustory` v1 file import (`artifact.rs`) and the
//! structured-folder creation (`structured_folder.rs`). The [`Missing`]
//! finding category and the [`Partial`] import state are emitted by the
//! FOLDER flow only — the `.rustory` flow still never emits them, and a
//! negative test locks that, mirroring the `Axis::Filesystem`
//! declared-but-unemitted axis in `preflight.rs`. [`Resolved`] is emitted
//! by the write-path review resolution only, never at analysis time.
//!
//! [`Missing`]: RecognitionCategory::Missing
//! [`Partial`]: ImportState::Partial
//! [`Resolved`]: ImportState::Resolved
