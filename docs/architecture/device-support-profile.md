# Device Support Profile

## Purpose

Authoritative public matrix of the device families, firmware cohorts
and operations Rustory is officially allowed to perform. Every line
here MUST have a corresponding test in
`src-tauri/src/application/device/mod.rs::tests::check_operation_*`
and a domain entry in `src-tauri/src/domain/device/profile.rs`.

This document is the source of truth that the
`application::device::check_operation_allowed` capability gate
implements. Any divergence between the matrix below and the gate
behavior is a bug.

## MVP Phase 1 Matrix

| Famille | Cohort firmware | Format métadonnées | Lecture biblio | Inspection histoire | Import histoire | Écriture (transfert) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lunii | Origine v1 (fw 1.x / 2.x) | v3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (Phase 1 — Epic 3 wires the gate) |
| Lunii | Mid-Gen v2 (fw 3.0 – 3.1) | v6 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (Phase 1 — Epic 3 wires the gate) |
| Lunii | V3 (fw 3.2.x +) | v7 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (RE actif — corruption risk) | ❌ (Phase 1 — Epic 3 wires the gate) |
| FLAM | — | — | ❌ (Post-MVP) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Detection Strategy

Rustory recognizes a Lunii in two stages:

1. **Auto-mount (Linux only)**: before each scan, Rustory asks
   udisks2 (over D-Bus, via the `zbus` blocking client) to mount any
   block device whose `Drive` path contains "STM" (the signature of
   the STM32-based USB bridge every observed Lunii ships with), whose
   `IdType` is `vfat`, whose `IdUsage` is `filesystem`, and whose
   `MountPoints` are empty. This filter intentionally rejects generic
   USB sticks (SanDisk, Kingston, …) so Rustory never mutates
   unrelated media without the user's intent. macOS and Windows mount
   USB Mass Storage volumes automatically — the auto-mount path is a
   no-op on those platforms. Set `RUSTORY_DEVICE_AUTOMOUNT=0` to
   disable it entirely.
2. **Filesystem scan**: Rustory enumerates mounted USB Mass Storage
   volumes (via `sysinfo::Disks` and the optional
   `RUSTORY_DEVICE_MOUNT_ROOTS` env-injected list) and probes each one
   for the canonical marker set at the volume root:

| Marker | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.md` | ✅ | Primary identifier; first byte = metadata format version |
| `.pi` | ✅ | Device-id payload; hashed (SHA-256, truncated to 32 hex chars) into the opaque `device_identifier` |
| `.bt` | informational | Binary token marker; surfaced for diagnostics but does NOT gate classification — a real Lunii V3 fw 3.3.2 was observed without `.bt` |
| `.ri` | informational | ROM info — not required by the MVP scan |
| `.li` | informational | Library info — not required by the MVP scan |

References (cross-checked across public OSS reverse-engineering
projects AND validated against a physical Lunii V3 sample, 2026-04-26):

- `marian-m12l/studio` (Java) — supports metadata v3 / v6 / v7.
- `o-daneel/Lunii.QT` (Python+Qt) — README documents the marker set
  for V1 / V2 / V3 cross-platform.
- `o-daneel/Lunii.RE` — Ghidra reverse engineering of the STM32
  firmwares; binary constants source.
- physical Lunii V3 fw 3.3.2 (2026-04-26): `.md` 128 B (first byte
  `0x07`) + `.pi` 32 B + `.pi.hidden` + `.cfg` + `.content/` + `.logo`
  + `etc/` — NO `.bt` present. This sample is the empirical proof
  that `.bt` cannot be a required marker.

## Refusal Reasons (closed set)

When classification refuses a candidate, the wire DTO carries a
`reason` value from this fixed set. Each value maps to one canonical
panel copy in `docs/architecture/ui-states.md#Disabled Actions and
Reasons`.

| Wire `reason` | Domain `UnsupportedReason` | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `firmwareUnsupported` | `FirmwareUnsupported` | Reserved for future per-firmware blocklists |
| `metadataUnsupported` | `MetadataUnsupported` | `.md` first byte is not in `{3, 6, 7}` |
| `metadataCorrupt` | `MetadataCorrupt` | `.pi` missing or empty, `.md` empty / oversize, FS read failed (`.bt` is informational only and never gates this reason) |
| `familyUnknown` | `FamilyUnknown` | Reserved for non-Lunii families discovered later |
| `operationNotAuthorized` | `OperationNotAuthorized` | Capability gate refusal at Epic 3 wiring time |
| `multipleCandidates` | `MultipleCandidates` | More than one supported Lunii detected at once |

## Capability Gate Contract

`application::device::check_operation_allowed(profile, operation)`:

- Returns `Ok(())` only when `profile.supported_operations.{operation}` is `true`.
- Returns `Err(AppError::DeviceUnsupported)` otherwise, with
  `details = { source: "capability_gate", operation: "<tag>",
  family: "<tag>", firmware_cohort: "<tag>" }`.
- MUST be called BEFORE any device write attempt. NFR17 + NFR18
  fail-closed.

Adding a new operation:

1. Add a boolean field on `SupportedOperations`.
2. Add the matching `SupportedOperation` enum variant + diagnostic tag.
3. Update the matrix above with the per-cohort allow value.
4. Add a per-cohort × per-operation test in `tests::check_operation_*`.

Adding a new cohort:

1. Add a `LuniiFirmwareCohort` variant + diagnostic tag.
2. Add the metadata-version → cohort branch in `classify_lunii`.
3. Update the matrix above with the operation values.
4. Add a per-version classification test.

A line in the matrix that has no test is a bug — the test enforces
that the gate behavior matches the published policy.
